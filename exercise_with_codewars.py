# Привет это kaluginpeter, сегодня порешаем задачи с Codewars. Let's do it

# Create a function that gives a personalized greeting. This function takes two parameters: name and owner.
# Use conditionals to return the proper message:
# case	             return
# name equals owner	 'Hello boss'
# otherwise	         'Hello guest'
def greet(name, owner):
    # Add code here

# A hero is on his way to the castle to complete his mission.
# However, he's been told that the castle is surrounded with a couple of powerful dragons!
# Each dragon takes 2 bullets to be defeated, our hero has no idea how many bullets he should carry..
# Assuming he's gonna grab a specific given number of bullets and move forward to fight another specific
# given number of dragons, will he survive?
# Return True if yes, False otherwise :)
def hero(bullets, dragons):
    if bullets // dragons == 2:
        return True
    elif bullets and dragons == 0:
            return True
    else:

# Create a function that takes an integer as an argument and returns "Even" for even numbers or "Odd" for odd numbers.
def even_or_odd(number):
    if number % 2 == 0:
        return 'Even'
    else:
        return 'Odd'

# Write a program that finds the summation of every number from 1 to num.
# The number will always be a positive integer greater than 0.
# For example:
# summation(2) -> 3
# 1 + 2
# summation(8) -> 36
# 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8
def summation(num):
    count = 0
    for i in range(num+1):
        count += i

# Given a string, you have to return a string in which each character (case-sensitive) is repeated once.
# Examples (Input -> Output):
# * "String"      -> "SSttrriinngg"
# * "Hello World" -> "HHeelllloo  WWoorrlldd"
# * "1234!_ "     -> "11223344!!__  "

# Upd: Hello it's again kaluginpeter. Today we make some tasks on Codewars
# Given an array of integers, return a new array with each value doubled.
# For example:
# [1, 2, 3] --> [2, 4, 6]
def maps(a):
    double_a = [i*2 for i in a]
    return double_a

# Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of the numbers.
# The numbers can be negative or non-integer. If the array does not contain any numbers then you should return 0.
# Examples
# Input: [1, 5.2, 4, 0, -1]
# Output: 9.2
# Input: []
# Output: 0
def sum_array(a):
    return sum(a)
# Хотя задачи носят решение короткого характера, думал я над ними довольно долго

# Your task is to create a function that does four basic mathematical operations.
# The function should take three arguments - operation(string/char), value1(number), value2(number).
# The function should return result of numbers after applying the chosen operation.
def basic_op(operator, value1, value2):

# Write a function which converts the input string to uppercase.

# Build a function that returns an array of integers from n to 1 where n>0.
# Example : n=5 --> [5,4,3,2,1]
def reverse_seq(n):
    numbers = list(range(n, 0, -1))
    return numbers

# Upd: Hello its kaluginpeter, continue make tasks on codewars
# Complete the function that accepts a string parameter, and reverses each word in the string.
# All spaces in the string should be retained.
# Examples:
# "This is an example!" ==> "sihT si na !elpmaxe"
# "double  spaces"      ==> "elbuod  secaps"
def reverse_words(text):

# We need a function that can transform a string into a number. What ways of achieving this do you know?
def string_to_number(s):
    return (int(s))

# In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative.
# But maybe the number is already negative?
# Examples
# make_negative(1);  # return -1
# make_negative(-5); # return -5
# make_negative(0);  # return 0
def make_negative( number ):
    return -abs(number)
